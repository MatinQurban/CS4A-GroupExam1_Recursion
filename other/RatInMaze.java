 * Rat In Maze Documentation (CS4A - Fall 2024)

High-Level Description:

To solve Rat in a Maze problem we approached using
recursive backtracking by exploring all possible paths from the starting position
(0, 0) to the destination (n-1, n-1) in a grid. At each cell, the program checks 
if moving right or down is valid ( for example, the cell is open and within bounds).
If a move is valid, the rat proceeds to the next cell recursively. If it reaches 
the destination, it adds the path to a list of solutions. If a path doesnâ€™t lead 
to the destination, it backtracks and tries the next direction. The process continues 
until all paths have been explored.

Model:

- The state passed between recursive calls consists of:
- The current position of the rat in the grid (row and column indices).
- The current path taken as a string or a list of coordinates.
- The maze itself, represented as a 2D array of boolean values (true for open cells,
false for cells the rat can not go).

/*
 * Testing Program:
 * 
   The provided main method acts as a testing program for the solver. 
   It initializes a sample maze and invokes the findPaths method, collecting all valid paths.
    
   Example Inputs and Outputs:

   Inputs:

   int[][] maze = {
       {1, 0, 0, 0},
       {1, 1, 0, 1},
       {0, 1, 0, 0},
       {1, 1, 1, 1} 
   };

   Expected Outputs:

   All Possible paths:
   RRDD
   RDRD
   RDDR

   Note: For the output letter "D" refers to move down
   and the letter "R" refers to move to the right.
