# CS4A-GroupExam1_Recursion
Solve 5 Recursion Problems in Java

Instructions
For each of these recursive backtracking problems, the following details should be submitted:
High-Level Description: An explanation of how recursive backtracking will be used to solve the problem.
Model: A description of the state that is passed between recursive calls.
Java Source Code: The implementation that solves the problem using recursive backtracking.
Testing Program: A Java program that tests the solver.
Inputs and Outputs: Example inputs to the solver and the expected output.
1. Permutations of a String
Problem Statement: Given a string, find all the possible permutations of its characters.
Objective: Generate all permutations of the string and return them in a list.
2. Sudoku Solver
Problem Statement: Given a partially filled 9x9 grid, fill in the blanks so that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contain all numbers from 1 to 9 exactly once.
Objective: Complete the grid by filling the empty cells correctly.
3. Word Search Puzzle
Problem Statement: Given a 2D board of characters and a word, check if the word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells (horizontal or vertical) without revisiting the same cell.
Objective: Determine if the word exists on the board and return true/false.
4. Rat in a Maze
Problem Statement: Given a maze represented as a grid with blocked and open cells, find a path for a rat to move from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. The rat can only move right or down.
Objective: Print one or all possible paths from the start to the destination.
5. Combination Sum
Problem Statement: Given an array of integers and a target sum, find all unique combinations where the numbers add up to the target. A number can be used multiple times.
Objective: Return a list of all possible combinations that sum up to the target.
